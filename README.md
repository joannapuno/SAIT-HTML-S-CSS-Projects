# Welcome!


Hello awesome human being(or..alien?) and thank you for taking the time to view my repos!
As you can see, most of my projects are coming from my classes here at SAIT.
Thatâ€™s because I am still a student and I am learning lots of things! I am loving this course so far and there are so many things I want to learn. I will be coming back to clean up my code after this program and see what else I can do to make my projects better.
